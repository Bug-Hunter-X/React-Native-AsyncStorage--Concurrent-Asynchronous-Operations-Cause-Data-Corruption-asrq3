This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data.  The issue manifests as data corruption or unexpected behavior, particularly when multiple asynchronous operations are performed concurrently.  The problem isn't immediately apparent because AsyncStorage's asynchronous nature can mask the timing conflicts. This can lead to unexpected data overwrites or inconsistent data reads, making debugging challenging.

```javascript
// buggy code in componentDidMount
componentDidMount() {
  AsyncStorage.setItem('key1', 'value1').then(() => {
    AsyncStorage.getItem('key1').then((value) => {
      console.log('Value:', value); // may not be 'value1' due to async issues
    });
  });
  AsyncStorage.setItem('key2', 'value2');
}
```
